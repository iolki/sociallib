To-do list 

1. On the "add books" page put a notice, that Amazon isbns do not work and in order to add books you should use isbns on real books you own. 
(Do we need to tell users that you can use Google Books isbns to add books?)  

2. Create a page refresh button on the main page so that users can randomly browse books by reloading the page. 

3. Get rid of the search function -- its not working properly and pisses people off. 

4. Update a copy on the main page ("Lend and borrow books withâ€¦") It should say that this is a service for people from Glastonbury.

5. More personal info about the person on the user page. Bio, favourite books, authors, likes and interests... 

6. Create a blog entry for users to post general feedback.

7. Create a "give us your feedback" button on the Sociall Library site linking directly to that post. 

8. Create an intro blogpost (Ken) -- who you are, what do tou want to do, whats your vision.  

9. Have a brainstorm on creative ways to inform community -- different blogposts basically, to trigger different ideas and thoughts.
