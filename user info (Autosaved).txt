About me: I'm very rude and nasty. 
I hate people, books and reading.
I'm extremely passionate about trashing other 
people's property and stealing stuff.
I'm eager to get in touch.

I'd also like to say, that I don't like 
writing too much but if anyone happens to 
write more here is 
the space where it will go.
